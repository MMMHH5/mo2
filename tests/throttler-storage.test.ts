/**
 * The rate limiter has to actually stop traffic.
 *
 * The configured limit was 300 req/min, and it never once fired: 1200 requests
 * to a single public endpoint inside one 60s window came back 200/200. The
 * counters lived in a Map inside each process, and Railway routes each request
 * to one of several replicas, so every replica saw a fraction of the traffic and
 * no replica ever reached its own limit. Measured on the deployed service,
 * sequential requests returned `x-ratelimit-remaining: 299` over and over -- the
 * count resetting per request is the fingerprint of a per-replica store.
 *
 * These cover the in-process path, which is what runs when REDIS_URL is absent,
 * so that fallback is known to enforce rather than merely to compile. The Redis
 * path shares this contract; what differs is that its counters survive a restart
 * and are visible to every replica.
