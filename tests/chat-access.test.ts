/**
 * Authorization tests for the batch (group) chat.
 *
 * A `ChatRoom` is one per course opening, and the caller has no `courseId` in
 * scope when they ask for a room: they name the room, or they get the list.
 * Both paths went wrong in ways that only showed up as "the chat did not open
 * for a student who was accepted":
 *
 *  - `getRooms` scoped by `openingId` only when the caller had at least one
 *    opening. With none it left `where` empty, which matched every room on the
 *    platform and returned each one's name, member count and last message.
 *  - `userHasRoomAccess` matched the student's enrollment on `courseId` instead
 *    of `openingId`, so being approved in one batch unlocked every other batch
 *    of the same course.
 *  - `getOrCreateDirectChat` required `enrollment.opening` to resolve the
 *    instructor. `Enrollment.openingId` is nullable and was added without a
 *    backfill, so an approved student with a legacy row was hard-403'd forever.
 *
 * These drive the real service against a recording double for Prisma, so they
 * assert the query the service builds — the part that decides who gets in.
