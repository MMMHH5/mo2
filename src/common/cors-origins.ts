 * the learner and admin surfaces to eventually live on separate origins, and
 * an admin route must never answer a browser that is not on the list.
 * `CORS_ORIGINS` lets an operator add origins (comma-separated) without a
 * code change; `FRONTEND_URL` stays an implicit member so existing set-ups do
 * not silently stop working.
