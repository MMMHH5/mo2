 * present, so an old field can be cleared rather than permanently shadowed.

 * and `specialtyAr/specialtyEn` with its existing `pick()` helper, exactly like
 * `Course.titleAr/titleEn` — so those pairs are kept.

 * hid them. The symptom was a 404 rather than an empty field: the course page
 * embeds `instructor: { id }` from `mapPublicCourse`, links that id to
 * `/public/instructors/:id`, and that route rejected the very user the course
 * page had just linked to. An instructor who filled in a full CV was one click
 * away from a "not found" page.
 *
 * So the predicate is now "teaches something, publicly", which is what the
 * routes actually mean. It cannot leak anything new: the email is still absent
 * from `PublicInstructor`, and these same users are already embedded, by id
 * and public fields only, in the public course payloads.
 *
 * `publishedOnly` is for the browse list, so a member of staff who only ever
 * touched an unpublished course is not enumerated. The detail route passes
