 * them. Unlocking once mints a token scoped to the operations API; it is signed
 * with the app's own secret and carries its own expiry, so it can be revoked by
 * not renewing it and it cannot be replayed as an access token because it is
 * verified on a claim the JWT strategy never sets.

     * and no network, so it is affordable on every request. If `JWT_SECRET` is
     * unset verification throws and the session is simply treated as anonymous,
